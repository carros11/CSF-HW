# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done.  When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.

### Problem 1
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

n = 100

total = 0

i = 1

while i <= n :
	
	total = total + i
	
	i = i + 1
	
print total

###
### Problem 2
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 2 solution follows:"


T = range( 2, 11 )

for i in T:
	
	print 1.0/i

### Problem 3
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in range (1, n + 1):
    triangular = triangular +i
print triangular
print n*(n+1)/2

###
### Problem 4
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"


n = 10

for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ) :

	total = total * i
	
print total
	

###
### Problem 5
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)

n = 10

while n > 0:

	total = 1
	
	for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ) :

		total = total * i
	
	print total
	n = n - 1

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"

n = 1

total2 = 1.0

while n <= 10:

	total = 1
	
	for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ) :

		total = total * i
	
	total2 = total2 + ( 1.0 / total)
	n = n + 1
